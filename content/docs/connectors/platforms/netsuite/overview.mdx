title: NetSuite Connector
description: Integrate NetSuite ERP with Field Nation for automated work order creation and service management synchronization.
---

## Overview

The NetSuite connector enables seamless integration between NetSuite ERP and Field Nation:
- **Service order dispatch**: Create work orders from NetSuite service records
- **SuiteTalk SOAP API**: Token-based authentication (TBA)
- **SuiteScript integration**: Custom triggers via SuiteScripts
- **Bidirectional sync**: Status, costs, and completion data flow both ways
- **Custom fields support**: Map NetSuite custom fields

## How It Works

<Steps>

### Deploy SuiteScript

Deploy custom SuiteScript in NetSuite that monitors service records

### Script Triggers

SuiteScript evaluates conditions (status change, custom field) and sends webhook

### Field Nation Receives

Integration Broker receives notification with NetSuite record ID

### Fetch Record Data

Broker retrieves complete record via SuiteTalk SOAP API

### Create Work Order

Transformed data creates Field Nation work order

</Steps>

---

## Common Use Cases

### Service Order Dispatch

```
Service Order Status = "Ready for Dispatch"
  → SuiteScript triggers
  → Work order created
  → Service order updated
```

### Case-Based Dispatch

```
Case Type = "On-Site Service"
AND Status = "Escalated"
  → Webhook fires
  → Field technician dispatched
```

### Financial Tracking

```
FN Work Order = "Approved"
  → NetSuite Service Order updated
  → Costs synchronized
  → Invoice generated
```

### NetSuite Requirements

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="Token-Based Authentication">
    Enable TBA in NetSuite:
    1. Setup → Company → Enable Features

## Authentication

NetSuite uses **Token-Based Authentication (TBA)** with OAuth 1.0:

```
Account ID: {account_id}
Consumer Key: {consumer_key}
Consumer Secret: {consumer_secret}
Token ID: {token_id}
Token Secret: {token_secret}
```

**Generate Credentials:**
1. Enable TBA in NetSuite Features
2. Create Integration Record → Get Consumer Key/Secret
3. Generate Access Token → Get Token ID/Secret
4. Note Account ID (found in Setup → Company Information)

<Callout type="warn">
**Security**: Token Secret shown ONCE during generation. Save immediately to secure location.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

- ✅ Use dedicated integration role
- ✅ Test SuiteScripts in sandbox account
- ✅ Monitor SuiteTalk API usage
- ✅ Handle NetSuite's complex data model carefully
- ✅ Document SuiteScript logic thoroughly

---

## Limitations

- SOAP-based API (more complex than REST)
- Token rotation required periodically
- SuiteScript deployment requires technical expertise
- Sublist/line item mapping can be complex
