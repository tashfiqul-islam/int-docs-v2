---

## Prerequisites

- ☐ [Field Nation configuration complete](/docs/connectors/platforms/quickbase/configuration)
- ☐ Trigger URL copied
- ☐ Quickbase app admin access

---

## Configure Automation in Quickbase

<Steps>

### Navigate to Automations

Open your Quickbase app → Settings (gear icon) → Automations

### Create New Automation

Click "+ Create a new automation"

### Configure Trigger

**Name**: `Send to Field Nation`

**Trigger**: "When a record is created or updated"

**Table**: Select your table (e.g., Service Requests)

**Conditions**:
```
Status is "Approved"
OR
Send to FN checkbox is checked
```

### Add Webhook Action

**Action Type**: "Make a request to a webhook"

**Method**: POST

**URL**: Paste Field Nation trigger URL

**Headers**:
```
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Body**:
```json
{
  "record_id": "[Record ID#]",
  "table_id": "[Table ID]",
  "app_id": "[App ID]"
}
```

Use Quickbase merge fields (buttons in automation builder) to insert dynamic values.

### Save & Activate

Save automation → Toggle to "Active"

</Steps>

---

## Test Integration

<Steps>

### Create Test Record

1. Open your Quickbase table
2. Add new record
3. Set status to "Approved" (or check trigger field)
4. Save

### Verify Automation

Quickbase → Settings → Automations → View your automation  
Check "Recent runs" for execution

### Check Field Nation

Verify work order created with correct data

</Steps>

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Conditional Logic

Add complex conditions:

```
Status = "Approved"
AND Priority ≥ High
AND NOT(Customer Name is blank)
AND Scheduled Date is not in the past
```

---

### Prevent Duplicate Sends

Add checkbox field: "Synced to FN"

**Automation Conditions:**
```
Status = "Approved"
AND "Synced to FN" is NOT checked
```

**Add Second Action:**
Update record → Set "Synced to FN" = checked

---

### Multiple Automations

**Automation 1**: Urgent Requests
```
Priority = "Urgent"
→ Immediate dispatch
```

**Automation 2**: Standard Requests
```
Status = "Approved"
AND Priority != "Urgent"
→ Normal dispatch
```

## Troubleshooting

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="Automation Not Running">
    - Check automation is "Active"
    - Verify record meets conditions
    - Review "Recent runs" for errors
    - Test with simple condition first
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Webhook Fails">
    - Verify trigger URL correct
    - Check webhook response in automation log
    - Test URL with external tool
    - Review Field Nation logs
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Work Order Not Creating">
    - Verify Field Nation credentials valid
    - Check all required fields mapped
    - Review Integration Broker logs
    - Test with minimal record data
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
