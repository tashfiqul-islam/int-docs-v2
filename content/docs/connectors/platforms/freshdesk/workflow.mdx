  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Automation Rules

**Rule 1**: Urgent Tickets
```
Priority = Urgent
→ Immediate dispatch
```

**Rule 2**: Standard Tickets
```
Status = "Field Service Required"
Priority != Urgent
→ Normal dispatch
```

### Prevent Duplicate Sends

Add custom field:
```
Field: "Synced to FN"
Type: Checkbox
```

Update rule conditions:
```
Status = "Field Service Required"
AND "Synced to FN" is NOT true
```

After sync, set checkbox to true.
