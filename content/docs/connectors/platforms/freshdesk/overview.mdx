## How It Works

<Steps>

### Configure Automation

Set up automation rule in Freshdesk that triggers on ticket status/tag changes

### Webhook Fires

### Fetch Ticket Data

Integration Broker retrieves complete ticket from Freshdesk REST API

### Apply Mappings

Transform Freshdesk ticket into Field Nation work order

### Create Work Order

Work order created with correlation ID for bidirectional sync

</Steps>

## Common Use Cases

### Dispatch from Support Ticket

```
Ticket Status = "Field Service Required"
  → Webhook triggers
  → Work order created
```

### Tag-Based Dispatch

```
Tag = "on-site"
  → Automation rule fires
  → Field technician dispatched
```

### Status Sync Back

```
FN Work Order = "Completed"
  → Freshdesk Ticket Status = "Resolved"
  → Private note added
```
