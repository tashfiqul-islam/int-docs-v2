## What Are Pre-built Connectors?

Pre-built connectors are **configuration-driven integrations** managed by Field Nation's Integration Broker middleware. Instead of building custom API integrations, you configure field mappings and business rules through a web interface. Field Nation handles authentication, data transformation, retries, and error recovery automatically.

### Key Benefits

## How Pre-built Connectors Work

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Ext as External System
    participant Broker as Integration Broker
    participant FN as Field Nation
    
    Note over Ext,FN: Inbound: External System → Field Nation
    Ext->>Broker: Webhook/API Trigger
    Broker->>Ext: Fetch Full Record Data
    Broker->>Broker: Apply Field Mappings
    Broker->>Broker: Transform with JSONNET
    Broker->>FN: Create/Update Work Order
    
    Note over Ext,FN: Outbound: Field Nation → External System
    FN->>Broker: Work Order Event
    Broker->>Broker: Apply Reverse Mappings
    Broker->>Ext: Update Record via API
    Ext-->>Broker: Confirmation
```

<Steps>

### Configuration in Field Nation

Configure authentication credentials, specify the external object to integrate, and set up field mappings through the Integration Broker UI.

### External Platform Setup

Configure webhooks or triggers in your external system to notify Field Nation when records are created or updated.

### Automatic Synchronization

The Integration Broker handles bidirectional sync:
- Creates Field Nation work orders from external records
- Syncs status changes, assignments, and completions back to external system
- Maintains data consistency with automatic retries

</Steps>

## When to Use Pre-built Connectors

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="✅ Use Pre-built Connectors When">
    - Your platform is supported (Salesforce, ServiceNow, etc.)
    - You need standard work order synchronization
    - You want minimal development effort
    - You prefer configuration over coding
    - You need Field Nation to manage updates and maintenance
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="⚠️ Consider REST API + Webhooks When">
    - You need highly custom workflows
    - Your platform isn't supported by pre-built connectors
    - You require advanced data transformations beyond JSONNET
    - You want complete control over integration logic
    - You have development resources available
    
    [REST API + Webhooks Guide →](/docs/getting-started/choosing-your-approach)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="💡 Use REST Connector When">
    - Your system has an OpenAPI specification
    - You need basic CRUD operations
    - You want configuration-driven approach
    - Your system isn't in the pre-built connector list

## Common Use Cases

### Dispatch from CRM
Automatically create Field Nation work orders when a Case, Ticket, or Opportunity reaches a specific status (e.g., "On-site Required").

### Status Synchronization
Reflect work order status changes (assigned, in progress, completed) back to your originating system in real-time.

### Provider Communication
Sync comments and messages between Field Nation technicians and your internal team through the external platform.

### Financial Tracking
Update work order costs, invoices, and payment status in your ERP or accounting system automatically.

## Architecture Overview

Pre-built connectors use Field Nation's **Integration Broker** - a microservices-based middleware that:

- **Authenticates** with external platforms (OAuth, API keys, Basic Auth)
- **Discovers Fields** automatically from external system metadata
- **Transforms Data** using configurable field mappings and JSONNET
- **Queues Messages** with Redis for reliable delivery and retries
- **Handles Errors** with automatic retries, dead letter queues, and alerting
