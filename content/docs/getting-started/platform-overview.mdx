## The Work Order Lifecycle

Every work order on Field Nation progresses through a well-defined lifecycle. Your integration will interact with work orders at various stages, so understanding this flow is essential.

![Work Order Lifecycle](./wo_lifecycle.png)

### Lifecycle Stages Explained

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Draft
    
    Work orders begin in draft status. You can edit all details—title, description, schedule, location, pay, tasks—before publishing.
    
    **Integration Actions:**
    - Create work orders via API
    - Update any field
    - Add attachments, tasks, custom fields
    - Delete if no longer needed
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Published
    
    Publishing makes work orders visible on the marketplace. Providers can request to be assigned or you can route to specific providers.
    
    **Integration Actions:**
    - Publish work orders
    - Monitor for provider requests
    - Route to preferred providers
    - Respond to provider questions via messages
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Routed
    
    Work orders in routed status have been sent to one or more providers. Providers can accept or decline routing invitations.
    
    **Integration Actions:**
    - Track which providers received routing
    - Monitor acceptance/decline responses
    - Route to additional providers if needed
    - Cancel routing if circumstances change
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Assigned
    
    An assigned work order has a committed provider. The provider has accepted responsibility for completing the work.
    
    **Integration Actions:**
    - Sync provider details to your system
    - Monitor schedule confirmations
    - Track "on my way" status
    - Receive check-in notifications
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Work Done
    
    The provider marks work complete and uploads deliverables (photos, notes, signatures). Buyers review before approval.
    
    **Integration Actions:**
    - Download deliverables
    - Review completion notes
    - Sync task completion status
    - Flag issues if work is incomplete
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Approved
    
    Buyers approve completed work, confirming quality and deliverables meet requirements. This triggers payment processing.
    
    **Integration Actions:**
    - Sync approval status
    - Record completion time
    - Close associated tickets
    - Update billing systems
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Paid
    
    Field Nation processes payment to the provider. The work order lifecycle is complete.
    
    **Integration Actions:**
    - Final status sync
    - Archive work order data
    - Generate completion reports
    - Update financial records
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  Work orders can also be **Cancelled** at any stage or **Postponed** if work needs to be rescheduled indefinitely.
</Callout>

## Core Platform Concepts

### Work Orders

Work orders are the foundation of Field Nation. Each work order represents a specific job that needs to be completed at a physical location.

**Key Components:**
- **Title & Description** - What work needs to be done
- **Schedule** - Service window (date/time range)
- **Location** - Physical address where work occurs
- **Pay** - Compensation structure (fixed, hourly, blended)
- **Tasks** - Checklist items (check-in, photos, etc.)
- **Custom Fields** - Your organization's specific data needs

### Providers

Providers are independent contractors who complete work orders. Field Nation has a marketplace of thousands of skilled technicians across various specialties.

**Provider Management:**
- **Talent Pools** - Groups of preferred providers
- **Rating System** - Performance tracking
- **Qualifications** - Skills and certifications
- **Availability** - Real-time scheduling

### Buyers

Buyers post work orders to the marketplace. As a buyer, you can:

- Create and manage work orders
- Route to specific providers
- Approve completed work
- Manage payments
- Access analytics and reporting

### Templates & Projects

**Templates** streamline work order creation by pre-configuring:
- Standard tasks
- Custom fields
- Payment structures
- Attachment requirements
- Contact information

**Projects** organize related work orders:
- Group similar work
- Apply consistent settings
- Track progress across multiple orders
- Manage provider teams

<Callout type="info" title="Best Practice">
  Use templates and projects to reduce the data your integration needs to send. Reference a template ID instead of defining every task and custom field in each API call.
</Callout>
