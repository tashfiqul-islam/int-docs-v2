## What Are Webhooks?

Webhooks are **server-to-server HTTP callbacks** that notify your system when specific events happen in Field Nation. Think of them as "reverse API calls" – instead of your system asking Field Nation for updates, Field Nation pushes updates to you.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant FN as Field Nation
    participant Your as Your System
    
    Note over FN: Work Order Published
    FN->>Your: POST https://your-endpoint.com/webhooks
    Note over Your: Process Event
    Your-->>FN: 200 OK
    Note over Your: Update Local Records
```

### How They Work

1. **Subscribe** - Register your HTTPS endpoint and select events to receive
2. **Event Occurs** - A work order is created, updated, or status changes
3. **Notification Sent** - Field Nation POSTs event payload to your endpoint
4. **Process & Respond** - Your system processes the event and returns 200 OK
5. **Automatic Retry** - If delivery fails, Field Nation retries with exponential backoff

## Why Use Webhooks?

<Cards>
  <Card title="Real-Time Synchronization" icon="Zap">
    Receive updates within seconds of events occurring. Keep your systems in sync without polling delays.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reduced API Load" icon="TrendingDown">
    Eliminate constant polling. Webhooks push data only when something changes, reducing API calls by 95%+.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Event-Driven Architecture" icon="Workflow">
    Build reactive workflows that trigger automatically. Assign providers, update ERP systems, send notifications—all in real-time.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cost Efficient" icon="DollarSign">
    Lower infrastructure costs. No need to run continuous polling jobs or maintain complex scheduling logic.

## Common Use Cases

### 1. **Work Order Lifecycle Automation**

Automatically respond to work order status changes:

- **Published** → Auto-assign to preferred provider
- **Assigned** → Update dispatch board, notify technician
- **Checked In** → Log start time in ERP system
- **Work Done** → Trigger approval workflow
- **Approved** → Generate invoice, update accounting system

### 2. **Real-Time Notifications**

Keep stakeholders informed instantly:

- Notify clients when work orders are completed
- Alert managers when providers decline assignments
- Send SMS/email when work is approved
- Update dashboards in real-time

### 3. **Data Synchronization**

Maintain consistent data across systems:

- Sync work order details to Salesforce, ServiceNow, or NetSuite
- Update custom dashboards and reporting tools
- Mirror Field Nation data in your database
- Replicate changes to multiple downstream systems

### 4. **Compliance & Auditing**

Track every change for regulatory requirements:

- Log all status transitions with timestamps
- Record who approved, declined, or modified work orders
- Maintain audit trails for compliance reporting
- Alert on specific event patterns

## When to Use Webhooks vs REST API

| Scenario | Use Webhooks | Use REST API |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Real-time updates** | ✅ Ideal | ❌ Requires polling |
| **Event-driven workflows** | ✅ Perfect fit | ⚠️ Complex to implement |
| **Creating work orders** | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Use POST requests |
| **Bulk data queries** | ❌ Not designed for this | ✅ Use GET endpoints |
| **On-demand data retrieval** | ❌ Event-based only | ✅ Query anytime |
| **Reducing API calls** | ✅ Push notifications | ❌ Constant polling |

<Callout type="info">
**Best Practice**: Use webhooks for event-driven updates and REST API for on-demand queries and write operations. Most integrations use both together.
