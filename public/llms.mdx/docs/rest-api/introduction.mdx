- `columns` - Control which fields are returned
- `sort` & `order` - Sort results

### Resource Relationships

The API provides rich relationships between resources:

```
Work Order
├── Location (address, coordinates, timezone)
├── Schedule (service window, ETA)
├── Pay (base, increases, discounts, bonuses, penalties)
├── Assignee (provider information)
├── Messages (communication thread)
├── Attachments (files, photos)
├── Tasks (checklist items with alerts)
├── Time Logs (clock in/out records)
├── Expenses (reimbursable costs)
├── Contacts (on-site contacts)
├── Qualifications (required certifications)
├── Custom Fields (company-specific data)
└── Signatures (completion signatures)
```

## Authentication

All API requests require OAuth 2.0 authentication:

1. **Obtain Token**: Call `/authentication/api/oauth/token` with client credentials
2. **Use Token**: Include as query parameter `?access_token=YOUR_TOKEN` in all requests
3. **Refresh**: Token expires after a period - obtain new token as needed

[Authentication guide →](/docs/rest-api/authentication)

## Response Format

All API responses are JSON with consistent structure:

**Successful Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 12345,
  "title": "Network Equipment Installation",
  "status": {
    "id": 2,

  },
  // ... other fields
}
```

**Error Response:**
```json

  "error": {
    "code": "InvalidRequest",
