## Field Nation Requirements

### Active Buyer Account

You must have an active Buyer account on the Field Nation platform. Buyer accounts enable you to:

- Post work orders to the marketplace
- Route and assign work to providers
- Access API credentials
- Configure webhooks and integrations

> [INFO] Don't have a Buyer account? [Sign up for Field Nation](https://www.fieldnation.com/signup) to get started.

### Integration Contract

Field Nation requires an integration contract before provisioning API access. This contract establishes:

- **Scope of integration** - Which systems you're connecting
- **Data access levels** - What information you can read/write
- **Support commitment** - Program management assistance
- **Sandbox access** - Development environment provisioning

  
    ### Contact Sales
    
    Reach out to your Field Nation sales representative or account manager to discuss your integration needs. If you don't have a contact, submit a request through the [Support Portal](https://support.fieldnation.com/s/).
  
  
  
    ### Kick-off Call
    
    Once your contract is in place, our integration program management team will schedule a kick-off call to understand your requirements and technical architecture.
  
  
  
    ### Sandbox Provisioning
    
    After the kick-off call, you'll receive:
    - Sandbox environment credentials
    - API client ID and secret
    - Webhook access
    - Documentation access
  

## Technical Requirements

### Development Environment

Ensure your development environment includes:

- **Programming language** - Any language with HTTP/REST support (Node.js, Python, Java, C#, PHP, Ruby, Go)
- **HTTPS capability** - For secure webhook endpoints
- **OAuth 2.0 support** - For API authentication
- **JSON parsing** - For request/response handling

### System Requirements

Your systems should be able to:

- Make outbound HTTPS requests to Field Nation APIs
- Receive inbound HTTPS requests (for webhooks)
- Store API credentials securely
- Handle JSON payloads up to 5MB
- Process asynchronous operations

### Network Requirements

  
    **Outbound Access Required:**
    
    - **Sandbox**: `https://api-sandbox.fndev.net`
    - **Production**: `https://api.fieldnation.com`
    
    **Ports**: 443 (HTTPS)
    
    **IP Whitelisting**: Not required for outbound API calls
  
  
  
    **Inbound Access Required:**
    
    Your webhook endpoint must be accessible from Field Nation's IP addresses:
    
    **Sandbox IPs:**
    ```
    44.225.211.232
    44.237.253.26
    ```
    
    **Production IPs:**
    ```
    3.226.5.230
    34.198.172.230
    ```
    
    If your firewall requires IP whitelisting, add these addresses to your allowlist.
  

## Knowledge Requirements

### Recommended Familiarity

While we provide comprehensive documentation, having familiarity with these concepts will accelerate your integration development:

- **REST API principles** - HTTP methods, status codes, headers
- **OAuth 2.0 authentication** - Client credentials grant flow
- **Webhook architecture** - Event-driven systems, HMAC signatures
- **JSON data structures** - Parsing, serialization, nested objects
- **Asynchronous programming** - Callbacks, promises, async/await

### Field Service Domain Knowledge

Understanding field service operations helps design better integrations:

- **Work order lifecycle** - Draft, published, routed, assigned, completed, approved
- **Provider management** - Routing, assignments, talent pools
- **Service windows** - Scheduling, time zones, ETAs
- **Task management** - Check-ins, check-outs, deliverables
- **Pay structures** - Base pay, expenses, bonuses, penalties

> **New to field service?** Review our [Platform Overview](/docs/getting-started/platform-overview) to understand the work order lifecycle before building your integration.

## Optional But Recommended

### Testing Tools

These tools make integration development easier:

- **[Postman](https://www.postman.com/)** or **[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)** - API testing and collection management
- **[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)** or **[localtunnel](https://localtunnel.me/)** - Expose local webhooks for testing
- **[Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/)** - Inspect webhook payloads
- **[JSON Formatter](https://jsonformatter.org/)** - Validate and format JSON

### Version Control

Use Git or another version control system to:

- Track changes to integration code
- Collaborate with team members
- Roll back to previous versions if needed
- Document deployment history

### Monitoring Tools

Consider setting up monitoring for:

- **API call volumes** - Track request rates and identify spikes
- **Error rates** - Alert on authentication or validation failures
- **Webhook delivery success** - Monitor notification reliability
- **Response times** - Ensure performance meets SLAs

## Company ID Location

You'll need your Field Nation Company ID for API requests and support cases. Here's how to find it:

  
    Log in to the [Field Nation Platform](https://app.fieldnation.com)
  
  
  
    Click your user icon in the top right corner, then select **Company Settings**
    
    ![Company Settings](/docs/get-started/settings_company.png)
  
  
  
    Click **Company Profile**. Your company ID appears in the URL:
    
    ```
    https://app.fieldnation.com/company/profile/12345
                                                    ^^^^^
                                              Your Company ID
    ```
    
    ![Company Profile](/docs/get-started/company_profile.png)
  

> Keep your Company ID handy—you'll need it when requesting sandbox access, submitting support cases, and configuring certain integrations.
