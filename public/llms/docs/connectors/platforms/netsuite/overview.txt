title: NetSuite Connector
description: Integrate NetSuite ERP with Field Nation for automated work order creation and service management synchronization.
---

## Overview

The NetSuite connector enables seamless integration between NetSuite ERP and Field Nation:
- **Service order dispatch**: Create work orders from NetSuite service records
- **SuiteTalk SOAP API**: Token-based authentication (TBA)
- **SuiteScript integration**: Custom triggers via SuiteScripts
- **Bidirectional sync**: Status, costs, and completion data flow both ways
- **Custom fields support**: Map NetSuite custom fields

---

## At a Glance


  
    Token-Based Authentication (TBA) - Account ID + Consumer Key/Secret + Token Key/Secret
  
  
    Service Orders, Cases, Custom Records
  
  
    SuiteScript + Webhooks
  
  
    Bidirectional (create, update, financial)
  


---

## How It Works



### Deploy SuiteScript

Deploy custom SuiteScript in NetSuite that monitors service records

### Script Triggers

SuiteScript evaluates conditions (status change, custom field) and sends webhook

### Field Nation Receives

Integration Broker receives notification with NetSuite record ID

### Fetch Record Data

Broker retrieves complete record via SuiteTalk SOAP API

### Create Work Order

Transformed data creates Field Nation work order



---

## Common Use Cases

### Service Order Dispatch

```
Service Order Status = "Ready for Dispatch"
  → SuiteScript triggers
  → Work order created
  → Service order updated
```

### Case-Based Dispatch

```
Case Type = "On-Site Service"
AND Status = "Escalated"
  → Webhook fires
  → Field technician dispatched
```

### Financial Tracking

```
FN Work Order = "Approved"
  → NetSuite Service Order updated
  → Costs synchronized
  → Invoice generated
```

## Prerequisites

### NetSuite Requirements


  
    Enable TBA in NetSuite:
    1. Setup → Company → Enable Features
    2. SuiteCloud → Token-Based Authentication ✅
    3. Save
  
  
  
    Create integration record:
    1. Setup → Integration → Manage Integrations → New
    2. Name: "Field Nation Integration"
    3. State: Enabled
    4. Copy: Consumer Key, Consumer Secret
  
  
  
    Generate access token:
    1. Setup → Users/Roles → Access Tokens → New
    2. Application Name: Field Nation Integration (from above)
    3. User: Integration user
    4. Role: Administrator or custom integration role
    5. Copy: Token ID, Token Secret
  
  
  
    - Ability to deploy SuiteScripts
    - Admin or developer role
    - Access to target record types

## Authentication

NetSuite uses **Token-Based Authentication (TBA)** with OAuth 1.0:

```
Account ID: {account_id}
Consumer Key: {consumer_key}
Consumer Secret: {consumer_secret}
Token ID: {token_id}
Token Secret: {token_secret}
```

**Generate Credentials:**
1. Enable TBA in NetSuite Features
2. Create Integration Record → Get Consumer Key/Secret
3. Generate Access Token → Get Token ID/Secret
4. Note Account ID (found in Setup → Company Information)

> **Security**: Token Secret shown ONCE during generation. Save immediately to secure location.

## Best Practices

- ✅ Use dedicated integration role
- ✅ Test SuiteScripts in sandbox account
- ✅ Monitor SuiteTalk API usage
- ✅ Handle NetSuite's complex data model carefully
- ✅ Document SuiteScript logic thoroughly

---

## Limitations

- SOAP-based API (more complex than REST)
- Token rotation required periodically
- SuiteScript deployment requires technical expertise
- Sublist/line item mapping can be complex
