## Troubleshooting


  
    - Check rule is Active
    - Verify ticket meets conditions
    - Review Audit Logs for execution
    - Test with simple conditions first
  
  
  
    - Verify trigger URL correct
    - Check Freshdesk can reach URL
    - Review webhook response in logs
    - Test URL with curl/Postman
  
  
  
    - Check Field Nation config valid
    - Verify all required fields mapped
    - Review Integration Broker logs
    - Test with minimal ticket data

## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Automation Rules

**Rule 1**: Urgent Tickets
```
Priority = Urgent
→ Immediate dispatch
```

**Rule 2**: Standard Tickets
```
Status = "Field Service Required"
Priority != Urgent
→ Normal dispatch
```

### Prevent Duplicate Sends

Add custom field:
```
Field: "Synced to FN"
Type: Checkbox
```

Update rule conditions:
```
Status = "Field Service Required"
AND "Synced to FN" is NOT true
```

After sync, set checkbox to true.
