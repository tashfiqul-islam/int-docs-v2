title: Freshdesk Connector
description: Integrate Freshdesk helpdesk with Field Nation for automated field service dispatch from support tickets.
---

## Overview

The Freshdesk connector enables seamless integration between Freshdesk and Field Nation:
- **Ticket-based dispatch**: Create work orders from Freshdesk tickets
- **REST API integration**: Simple authentication via API key
- **Webhook triggers**: Real-time notifications
- **Bidirectional sync**: Status and notes flow both directions
- **Custom fields support**: Map Freshdesk custom fields

## At a Glance


  
    API Key (Basic Auth)
  
  
    Tickets
  
  
    Webhooks (automation rules)
  
  
    Bidirectional (create, update, notes)
  


---

## How It Works



### Configure Automation

Set up automation rule in Freshdesk that triggers on ticket status/tag changes

### Webhook Fires

Freshdesk sends ticket ID to Field Nation when conditions met

### Fetch Ticket Data

Integration Broker retrieves complete ticket from Freshdesk REST API

### Apply Mappings

Transform Freshdesk ticket into Field Nation work order

### Create Work Order

Work order created with correlation ID for bidirectional sync



---

## Common Use Cases

### Dispatch from Support Ticket

```
Ticket Status = "Field Service Required"
  → Webhook triggers
  → Work order created
```

### Tag-Based Dispatch

```
Tag = "on-site"
  → Automation rule fires
  → Field technician dispatched
```

### Status Sync Back

```
FN Work Order = "Completed"
  → Freshdesk Ticket Status = "Resolved"
  → Private note added
```

## Authentication

Freshdesk uses **Basic Authentication** with API key:

Password: X (literal "X")
```

**Example:**

```

> [INFO] **Simple Setup**: Freshdesk uses API key as username, literal "X" as password for Basic Auth.
