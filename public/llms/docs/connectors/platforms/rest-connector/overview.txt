title: REST Connector
description: Universal OpenAPI-based connector to integrate Field Nation with any system that provides an OpenAPI specification.
---

## Overview

The REST Connector enables integration with **any REST API** that has an OpenAPI specification:
- **Upload OpenAPI spec**: System automatically discovers endpoints and data models
- **Configure endpoints**: Select CRUD operations from dropdown menus
- **Map fields**: Use standard field mapping UI populated from spec
- **Basic Authentication**: Simple username:password credentials
- **No code required**: Configuration-driven setup

---

## Key Features

  
    Works with ANY system that has an OpenAPI spec
  
  
    Automatically reads endpoints and models from spec
  
  
    Select endpoints from dropdowns, no coding needed
  
  
    Use familiar field mapping UI and transformations
  

---

## How It Works

### Upload OpenAPI Spec

Upload your system's OpenAPI (Swagger) specification file (JSON or YAML)

### Configure Endpoints

Select endpoints for each operation from dropdown menus:
- **Record Metadata**: Get field definitions
- **Record Fetch**: Retrieve single record
- **Record Create**: Create new records
- **Record Update**: Update existing records
- **Attachments Upload**: Upload files (optional)

### Set Authentication

Provide Basic Auth credentials (username:password format)

### Refresh Fields

Click "Refresh Fields" to fetch field definitions from your API

### Map Fields

Configure standard field mappings using discovered fields

### Test & Deploy

Test with sample data, then activate for production use

## When to Use REST Connector

### ✅ Use REST Connector When

  
    Your platform doesn't have a pre-built connector but has an OpenAPI spec.
    
    **Examples:**
    - Custom internal systems
    - Niche vertical applications
    - Proprietary FSM platforms
    - Industry-specific tools
  
  
  
    Your system provides an OpenAPI/Swagger specification file.
    
    **Formats Supported:**
    - OpenAPI 3.x (JSON or YAML)
    - OpenAPI 2.x / Swagger 2.0
    - Most API documentation tools generate these automatically
  
  
  
    You need standard create/read/update operations without complex workflows.
    
    **Supported:**
    - Create work orders → Create records in your system
    - Update work orders → Update records in your system
    - Fetch record data → Query your system's API
    - Upload attachments → Send files to your system
    
    **Not Supported (use REST API + Webhooks instead):**
    - Complex multi-step workflows
    - Advanced business logic
    - Custom validation rules
    - Real-time bidirectional sync requirements beyond standard operations
  
  
  
    You prefer UI configuration over custom code development.
    
    **Benefits:**
    - No development required
    - Faster deployment than custom integration
    - Maintained by Field Nation
    - Standard field mapping UI

### ⚠️ Limitations

The REST Connector is built for **standard CRUD operations**. It may not support:

> [INFO] **Extensibility**: The REST Connector was built for specific use cases and can be extended with additional functionality as needed. Contact [Field Nation Support](https://app.fieldnation.com/support-cases) to discuss feature requirements.

---

## Common Use Cases

### Custom FSM Platform Integration

Your company uses a proprietary Field Service Management system with REST API and OpenAPI spec.

**Configuration:**
- Upload system's OpenAPI spec
- Select `/api/v1/tickets` (create) endpoint
- Select `/api/v1/tickets/{id}` (fetch/update) endpoints
- Map Field Nation work order fields to ticket fields
- Enable bidirectional sync for status updates

---

### ERP System Integration

Integrate with mid-market ERP without pre-built connector.

**Configuration:**
- Upload ERP's API specification
- Select `/work_orders/create` endpoint
- Select `/work_orders/{id}/update` endpoint
- Map financial fields (cost, budget, billing codes)
- Sync completion status back to ERP

---

### Vertical-Specific Application

Industry-specific platform (healthcare, retail, manufacturing) with custom data models.

**Configuration:**
- Upload application's OpenAPI spec
- Map custom fields to application's unique data structures
- Use JSONNET for industry-specific transformations
- Sync status and completion data bidirectionally

---

## Prerequisites

### External System Requirements

  
    **Required**: Valid OpenAPI/Swagger specification file
    
    **Format:**
    - OpenAPI 3.x (JSON or YAML)
    - OpenAPI 2.x / Swagger 2.0 (JSON or YAML)
    
    **Must Include:**
    - Endpoint paths and HTTP methods
    - Request/response schemas
    - Authentication schemes
    - Parameter definitions
    
    **How to Get:**
    - Most modern APIs provide this automatically
    - Check API documentation portal
    - Tools: Swagger UI, Postman, Stoplight
    - May be available at `/swagger.json` or `/api-docs`
  
  
  
    **Minimum Required Endpoints:**
    
    **Record Create** (Required)
    - Creates new records in your system
    - Example: `POST /api/v1/tickets`
    
    **Record Fetch** (Required)
    - Retrieves single record by ID
    - Example: `GET /api/v1/tickets/{id}`
    
    **Record Metadata** (Required)
    - Returns field definitions/schema
    - Example: `GET /api/v1/tickets/metadata` or included in spec
    
    **Record Update** (Recommended)
    - Updates existing records
    - Example: `PUT /api/v1/tickets/{id}` or `PATCH /api/v1/tickets/{id}`
    
    **Attachments Upload** (Optional)
    - Uploads files/attachments
    - Example: `POST /api/v1/tickets/{id}/attachments`
  
  
  
    **Required**: REST API must support Basic Auth
    
    **Format**: `Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)`
    
    **Other Auth Methods Not Supported:**
    - ❌ OAuth 2.0 (use REST API integration)
    - ❌ API Keys in headers (use REST API integration)
    - ❌ Custom authentication schemes
    - ❌ JWT/Bearer tokens (unless wrapped in Basic Auth)
    
    If your API doesn't support Basic Auth, consider:
    - Adding Basic Auth layer via API gateway
    - Using REST API + Webhooks integration instead
  
  
  
    **Outbound from External System** (Inbound sync)
    - System can send webhooks to Field Nation
    - Not blocked by firewall
    - HTTPS/TLS support
    
    **Inbound to External System** (Outbound sync)
    - Field Nation can reach your API endpoints
    - Public internet or VPN access
    - IP whitelisting configured (if required)

### Field Nation Requirements

- Active buyer account with admin access
- Integration settings access
- Sandbox environment (recommended for testing)

---

## Authentication

REST Connector uses **Basic Authentication** only:

```
Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)
```

**Configuration:**
- Enter credentials in `username:password` format
- Example: `api_user:my_secure_password123`
- Field Nation encodes credentials automatically
- Credentials encrypted at rest (AES-256)

**Best Practices:**
- Use dedicated API user (not personal account)
- Grant minimum required permissions
- Rotate credentials periodically
- Use strong, unique passwords

---

## Supported Functionality

### ✅ What REST Connector Can Do

- **Create Records**: Create records in external system when FN work order created/updated
- **Update Records**: Update external records when FN work order status changes
- **Fetch Data**: Retrieve field values from external system for field mapping
- **Field Mapping**: Standard field mappings with all transformation actions
- **Custom Actions**: JSONNET transformations for complex data manipulation
- **Attachments**: Upload files to external system (if endpoint configured)
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Status updates flow both directions
- **Correlation IDs**: Track linked records across systems

### ⚠️ What REST Connector May Not Support

- OAuth or API key authentication
- Complex multi-step workflows
- Real-time streaming data
- GraphQL queries (REST only)
- SOAP web services (REST only)
- Custom headers or authentication schemes
- Advanced error recovery beyond standard retries

For these requirements, consider [REST API + Webhooks integration](/docs/getting-started/choosing-your-approach).
