## Prerequisites

## Configure Callback in ConnectWise

**Object Type**: `Service Ticket`

**Level**: `Owner Level` or `All Levels`

**Trigger Events:**

## Define Trigger Conditions

**Option 1: Status-Based**
```
Status changed to "Dispatch"
```

**Option 2: Board-Based**
```
Board = "Field Services"
```

**Option 3: Custom Field**
```
Custom Field "Send to FN" = true
```

Use ConnectWise workflow rules or automation to set these conditions.

## Test Integration

1. Create test service ticket
2. Update to trigger callback conditions
3. Verify webhook fires (System → Callback Log)
4. Check Field Nation for work order
