title: Quickbase Connector
description: Integrate Quickbase applications with Field Nation for automated work order creation and bidirectional data synchronization.
---

## Overview

The Quickbase connector enables seamless integration between Quickbase applications and Field Nation:
- **Table-based sync**: Create work orders from any Quickbase table
- **REST API integration**: Modern JSON API with user tokens
- **Webhook triggers**: Real-time notifications via Quickbase automations
- **Bidirectional sync**: Data flows both directions automatically
- **Custom fields support**: Map any Quickbase field

---

## At a Glance


  
    User Token (Bearer token)
  
  
    Any Quickbase table in your apps
  
  
    Quickbase Automations (webhooks)
  
  
    Bidirectional (create, update)
  


---

## How It Works



### Configure Automation

Create Quickbase automation that triggers on record changes

### Webhook Fires

Quickbase sends record ID to Field Nation when conditions met

### Fetch Record Data

Integration Broker retrieves complete record from Quickbase REST API

### Apply Mappings

Transform Quickbase record into Field Nation work order

### Create Work Order

Work order created with correlation ID for bidirectional sync



---

## Common Use Cases

### Service Request Dispatch

```
Table: Service Requests
Trigger: Status = "Approved"
  → Work order created in Field Nation
```

### Work Order Tracking

```
Table: Field Work Orders
Trigger: New record added
  → Automatic Field Nation dispatch
```

### Status Synchronization

```
FN Work Order = "Completed"
  → Quickbase record Status = "Complete"
  → Completion date updated
```

## Features

### Field Mapping Capabilities

- **All Field Types**: Text, numeric, date, checkbox, user, relationship
- **Formula Fields**: Access calculated values
- **Related Tables**: Map fields from related tables via relationships
- **Multi-select fields**: Handle comma-separated values
- **File Attachments**: Optional file sync

### Supported Operations

## Prerequisites

### Quickbase Requirements


  
    Generate in Quickbase:
    1. Profile → Manage User Tokens
    2. "+ New User Token"
    3. Name: "Field Nation Integration"
    4. Assign all apps needed
    5. Copy token (shown once)
  
  
  
    - Admin access to Quickbase app
    - Table must have webhook automation capabilities
    - User token must have access to table
  
  
  
    - Read access to all fields to sync
    - Write access for status updates
    - Access to related tables
  


---

## Authentication

Quickbase uses **User Token** (Bearer token):

```
Authorization: QB-USER-TOKEN {user_token}
```

**Generate Token:**
1. Quickbase → Profile → Manage User Tokens
2. New User Token
3. Select applications to grant access
4. Copy token immediately (shown once)

> **Security**: User tokens have same permissions as user. Create dedicated integration user with minimum required access.

---

## Best Practices

- ✅ Use dedicated integration user
- ✅ Grant minimum table access needed
- ✅ Test in sandbox app first
- ✅ Use Quickbase automations (not external webhooks)
- ✅ Monitor API usage limits

---

## Limitations

- API rate limits: 10 requests/second per user token
- Each sync consumes 2-3 API calls
- Complex relationships may require custom JSONNET
- Formula fields are read-only
