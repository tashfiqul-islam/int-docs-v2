title: Autotask Connector
description: Integrate Datto Autotask PSA with Field Nation for automated field service dispatch from service tickets and work orders.
---

## Overview

The Autotask connector enables seamless integration between Datto Autotask PSA and Field Nation:
- **Ticket-based dispatch**: Automatically create work orders from Autotask Tickets
- **SOAP API integration**: Secure authentication via token-based SOAP calls
- **Bidirectional sync**: Status updates flow both directions
- **Flexible triggers**: Configure based on ticket status, type, or custom fields
- **UDF support**: Map User-Defined Fields between systems

---

## At a Glance


  
    API Integration Token + SOAP Credentials
  
  
    Tickets, Service Calls, Projects
  
  
    Webhooks + API Polling (configurable)
  
  
    Bidirectional (create, update, notes)
  


---

## How It Works



### Configure Webhook

Set up webhook in Autotask that triggers on ticket status changes or custom field updates

### Webhook Notification

Autotask sends ticket ID to Field Nation when trigger conditions met

### Field Nation Fetches Data

Integration Broker retrieves complete ticket data from Autotask SOAP API

### Apply Mappings

Broker transforms Autotask ticket data into Field Nation work order format

### Create Work Order

Work order created in Field Nation with correlation ID stored for bidirectional sync



---

## Common Use Cases

### Dispatch from Service Ticket

Automatically create Field Nation work order when Autotask Ticket requires on-site service

```
Ticket Status = "Dispatch to Field" 
  → Webhook triggers 
  → Field Nation Work Order Created
```

### Project-Based Dispatch

Create work orders from Autotask Project tasks requiring field technicians

```
Project Task Type = "On-Site"
AND Task Status = "Ready"
  → Work order created
  → Task updated with FN details
```

### Status Synchronization

Reflect Field Nation work order completion back to Autotask Ticket

```
FN Work Order = "Completed"
  → Integration Broker
  → Autotask Ticket Status = "Complete - Customer Notified"
  → Internal Notes updated
```

```

## Features

### Field Mapping Capabilities

- **Standard Fields**: Title, Description, Status, Priority, Due Date
- **User-Defined Fields**: Access any UDF on Ticket entity
- **Related Entities**: Account, Contact, Resource (assigned technician)
- **Picklist Fields**: Map Autotask picklists to Field Nation enums
- **Date/Time Fields**: Automatic timezone conversion

### Supported Operations

## Prerequisites

### Autotask Requirements


  
    - Autotask PSA license with API access enabled
    - Admin or API-enabled user account
    - SOAP API credentials generated
    - Integration tracking identifier configured
  
  
  
    Generate in Autotask:
    1. Navigate to Admin → Resources (Users)
    2. Select API user
    3. Generate API Integration Code
    4. Generate API Security Token
    5. Copy both for Field Nation configuration
  
  
  
    - Ability to configure Autotask webhooks
    - Webhook endpoint URL from Field Nation
    - Network access to send webhooks
    - Optional: IP whitelisting for Field Nation
  
  
  
    API user must have:
    - Read access to Ticket entity and all fields to sync
    - Write access to fields for status/note updates
    - Access to related entities (Account, Contact, Resource)
    - Permission to view User-Defined Fields
  


### Field Nation Requirements

- Active buyer account with admin access
- Integration settings access
- Sandbox environment (recommended for testing)

## Authentication

Autotask connector uses **SOAP API with Token Authentication**:

```
Username: API user email
Password: API user password
Integration Code: {integration_code}
Security Token: {security_token}
```

**Components:**
- **Username**: Autotask user email with API access
- **Password**: User's password
- **Integration Code**: Generated tracking identifier
- **Security Token**: API authentication token

**Generate Credentials:**
1. Log into Autotask as admin
2. Admin → Resources (Users) → Select API user
3. API Integration section → Generate Integration Code
4. Generate Security Token (if not already generated)
5. Copy all credentials for Field Nation configuration

> **Security Best Practice**: Use dedicated API user (not personal account). Integration Code is unique per integration - generate new code for Field Nation.

## Data Flow Patterns

### Inbound: Autotask → Field Nation

**Trigger**: Webhook fired on ticket status change  
**Action**: Webhook sends Ticket ID to Field Nation  
**Result**: Field Nation work order created/updated

**Example Webhook Triggers:**
- Ticket Status = "Dispatch to Field"
- Custom UDF "Send to FN" = Yes
- Issue Type = "On-Site Required"
- Queue = "Field Services"

---

### Outbound: Field Nation → Autotask

**Trigger**: Field Nation work order event (completed, etc.)  
**Action**: Integration Broker calls Autotask SOAP API  
**Result**: Autotask Ticket updated with status/notes

**Configurable Events:**
- Work order assigned → Update Ticket Status
- Work order completed → Add Internal Note with details
- Provider checked in → Update custom UDF
- Work order approved → Update Status to "Complete"

---

## Best Practices

### Webhook Design

- ✅ Use specific status values (not "any change")
- ✅ Configure webhook for relevant ticket types only
- ✅ Add safeguards to prevent duplicate triggers
- ✅ Test in sandbox Autotask instance first
- ✅ Monitor webhook delivery logs

### Field Mappings

- ✅ Map all required Field Nation fields
- ✅ Use User-Defined Fields for custom data
- ✅ Handle Autotask picklists with Array Map
- ✅ Test timezone conversions for date fields
- ✅ Document UDF IDs and purposes

### Security

- ✅ Use dedicated API user
- ✅ Rotate Security Token periodically
- ✅ Grant minimum required permissions
- ✅ Monitor API usage limits
- ✅ Enable IP whitelisting if policy requires

---

## Limitations & Considerations

### API Limits

Autotask enforces API call limits:
- Varies by license type and contract
- Monitor usage in Autotask Admin → API Usage

Each work order sync consumes **2-3 API calls** (authentication + data retrieval + optional update).

### SOAP API Complexity

- SOAP-based (not REST) - more complex than modern APIs
- XML payload parsing required
- Field discovery may require manual configuration
- Some fields may not be accessible via API

### Related Entity Depth

Can access:
- ✅ Fields on Ticket entity
- ✅ Fields from related Account, Contact, Resource
- ❌ Grand-parent relationships (requires custom JSONNET)
