### External Platform Requirements


  
    You need administrative access in your external platform (Salesforce, ServiceNow, etc.) to:
    - Create API credentials or OAuth applications
    - Configure webhooks or outbound messages
    - Set up automation rules (Flows, Business Rules, etc.)
    - Grant API permissions to integration users
  
  
  
    Depending on the platform, you'll need:
    - **API Keys** - Unique identifiers for API access
    - **OAuth Tokens** - For OAuth 2.0 authenticated platforms
    - **Username & Password** - For Basic Authentication systems
    - **Security Tokens** - Platform-specific security credentials
    
    These are typically generated in the external platform's API or integration settings.
  
  
  
    Ensure your external platform can:
    - **Receive webhooks** from Field Nation's IP addresses
    - **Make outbound API calls** to Field Nation's endpoints
    - **Allow API access** (not blocked by firewalls or security policies)
    
    Some enterprise platforms require IP whitelisting or firewall rule adjustments.
  
  
  
    The integration user must have:
    - **Read access** to all fields you want to sync FROM the external system
    - **Write access** to all fields you want to update IN the external system
    - **API-enabled permissions** on custom objects and fields
    - **Create/Update permissions** for the object types being synchronized

## Common Setup Workflow

All pre-built connectors follow a similar configuration pattern:



### Gather Credentials

Collect required information from your external platform:
- API credentials (keys, tokens, username/password)
- Instance URLs or identifiers
- Object names or IDs you want to integrate
- Security tokens (if applicable)

### Configure in Field Nation

1. Navigate to Integration Settings in Field Nation
2. Select your connector from available integrations
3. Enter connection credentials
4. Specify the external object to integrate with
5. Configure optional settings (messaging, custom fields)
6. Test connection and save

### Configure External Platform

1. Set up webhook or outbound message
2. Configure automation rules (Flows, triggers, etc.)
3. Map Field Nation's trigger URL as the destination
4. Define conditions for when to send data to Field Nation
5. Test the trigger

### Map Fields

1. Field Nation automatically discovers available fields
2. Configure field mappings (source field → target field)
3. Set transformation actions (sync, static, date convert, etc.)
4. Add custom JSONNET transformations if needed
5. Save field mappings

### Test Integration

1. Create a test record in your external system
2. Trigger the automation (meet your Flow/rule conditions)
3. Verify Field Nation work order is created
4. Update the work order in Field Nation
5. Confirm updates sync back to external system

### Go Live

1. Monitor first few synchronizations
2. Review error logs for any issues
3. Adjust field mappings if needed
4. Document configuration for your team
5. Set up alerting for integration errors

## Integration Broker Access

All pre-built connectors are configured through Field Nation's **Integration Broker** interface:

**Sandbox**: [ui-sandbox.fndev.net/integrations](https://ui-sandbox.fndev.net/integrations)  
**Production**: [app.fieldnation.com/integrations](https://app.fieldnation.com/integrations)

> [INFO] **First Time Setup**: If you don't see the Integrations section, contact [Field Nation Support](https://app.fieldnation.com/support-cases) to enable connector access for your account.

## Understanding Field Mappings

Field mappings define how data translates between systems. Each mapping consists of:

### Mapping Components



### Common Transformation Actions

**Sync** - Direct field-to-field copy with no transformation

**Set Static** - Always use a specific value (e.g., always set priority to "High")

**Date Convert** - Transform date formats between systems

**Concat** - Combine multiple fields into one (e.g., FirstName + LastName → FullName)

**Array Map** - Transform array or list data

**Range Map** - Map value ranges (e.g., 1-3 → Low, 4-7 → Medium, 8-10 → High)

**Custom JSONNET** - Write custom transformation logic for complex scenarios

## Data Flow Patterns

### Inbound: External System → Field Nation

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Record Created/Updated] --> B[Webhook Triggered]
    B --> C[Integration Broker]
    C --> D[Fetch Full Record]
    D --> E[Apply Field Mappings]
    E --> F[Create/Update Work Order]
    F --> G[Log Success]
```

**Trigger**: Record change in external system  
**Result**: Field Nation work order created or updated

---

### Outbound: Field Nation → External System

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Work Order Event] --> B[Integration Broker]
    B --> C[Apply Reverse Mappings]
    C --> D[Call External API]
    D --> E[Update Record]
    E --> F[Confirm Sync]
```

**Trigger**: Work order status change, assignment, completion, etc.  
**Result**: External system record updated

## Authentication Methods

Different platforms use different authentication approaches:





**Used by**: Freshdesk, some custom REST APIs

**Configuration**:
- Username
- Password
- Optional: Security Token

**Format**: `Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)`





**Used by**: Salesforce, ServiceNow (optional)

**Configuration**:
- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Authorization URL
- Token URL
- Scopes

**Flow**: Authorization Code or Client Credentials





**Used by**: Quickbase, Smartsheet

**Configuration**:
- API Key or Application Token
- Optional: API Secret

**Format**: Custom header (e.g., `X-API-Key: your-key`)





**Used by**: NetSuite, Autotask

**Configuration**:
- Account ID
- Integration Token
- Consumer Key/Secret
- Token Key/Secret

**Format**: Platform-specific SOAP authentication

## Best Practices

### Before Configuration

- ☐ Test in sandbox environment first
- ☐ Document current workflow and requirements
- ☐ Identify which fields need to sync
- ☐ Plan for error handling and monitoring
- ☐ Review external platform's API limits

### During Configuration

- ☐ Use descriptive names for field mappings
- ☐ Start with minimal field set, expand later
- ☐ Test each mapping individually
- ☐ Document transformation logic
- ☐ Keep track of credentials securely

### After Configuration

- ☐ Monitor first 24 hours closely
- ☐ Set up error notifications
- ☐ Create runbook for common issues
- ☐ Train team on monitoring dashboards
- ☐ Schedule regular health checks

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid


  
    **Problem**: Integration fails due to missing permissions
    
    **Solution**: Ensure integration user has full API access and permissions for all objects and fields being synchronized
  
  
  
    **Problem**: Data fails to sync due to type mismatches
    
    **Solution**: Use appropriate transformation actions (Date Convert, Range Map) to match field types between systems
  
  
  
    **Problem**: Work order creation fails due to missing required data
    
    **Solution**: Either map all required fields or set static default values for fields not available in source system
  
  
  
    **Problem**: No data flows to Field Nation
    
    **Solution**: Verify webhook configuration, check firewall rules, confirm trigger conditions are met
  
  
  
    **Problem**: Integration stops working after some time
    
    **Solution**: Refresh OAuth tokens, verify credentials haven't been reset, check for password policy changes

## Testing Your Configuration

### Create Test Scenarios

1. **Happy Path**: Standard work order creation and completion
2. **Required Fields**: Ensure all required fields are populated
3. **Optional Fields**: Verify optional fields sync correctly
4. **Status Changes**: Test bidirectional status synchronization
5. **Error Handling**: Intentionally trigger errors to verify error handling

### Test Checklist

- ☐ Work order created in Field Nation from external record
- ☐ All mapped fields populated correctly
- ☐ Status updates sync bidirectionally
- ☐ Comments/messages sync (if enabled)
- ☐ Error notifications received when sync fails
- ☐ Retry logic works for temporary failures
- ☐ Duplicate prevention works (same record not created twice)
