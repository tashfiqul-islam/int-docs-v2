## Event Filtering

When creating a webhook, you can subscribe to:

### All Events

```json
{
  "events": [
    "workorder.created",
    "workorder.routed",
    // ... all 33 events
  ]
}
```

### Specific Categories

**Lifecycle events only:**

```json
{
  "events": [
    "workorder.created",
    "workorder.routed",
    "workorder.requested",
    "workorder.declined",
    "workorder.task_completed"
  ]
}
```

**Status changes only:**

```json
{
  "events": [
    "workorder.status.published",
    "workorder.status.assigned",
    "workorder.status.checked_in",
    "workorder.status.work_done",
    "workorder.status.approved",
    "workorder.status.paid"
  ]
}
```

### Critical Events

For minimal integration, start with these high-value events:

```json
{
  "events": [
    "workorder.status.published",    // Work order available
    "workorder.status.assigned",     // Provider assigned
    "workorder.status.work_done",    // Work completed
    "workorder.status.approved"      // Ready for payment
  ]
}
```

## Event Naming Convention

Events follow a consistent pattern:

```plaintext
{resource}.{action or status}.{optional_sub_status}
```

**Examples:**

- `workorder.created` - Resource: workorder, Action: created
- `workorder.status.published` - Resource: workorder, Category: status, Status: published
- `workorder.task_completed` - Resource: workorder, Action: task_completed

## Best Practices

### Start Small, Expand Later



### Begin with Core Events

Subscribe to 4-6 critical events initially:
- `workorder.created`
- `workorder.status.assigned`
- `workorder.status.work_done`
- `workorder.status.approved`

### Test Thoroughly

Verify your system handles events correctly before adding more.

### Add Events Incrementally

Expand to additional events as you build new features.



### Filter Strategically

Don't subscribe to events you won't use:

- ❌ **Bad**: Subscribe to all 33 events "just in case"
- ✅ **Good**: Subscribe only to events your system processes

Unnecessary events increase:
- Processing overhead
- Delivery log volume
- Potential for bugs

### Document Your Event Handling

Maintain internal documentation:

```markdown
| Event                       | Handler          | Purpose                 |
|-----------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| workorder.status.published  | publishHandler() | Notify provider network |
| workorder.status.assigned   | assignHandler()  | Update dispatch board   |
| workorder.status.work_done  | completeHandler()| Trigger approval flow   |
```
