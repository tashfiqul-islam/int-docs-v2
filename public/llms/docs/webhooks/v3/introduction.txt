## What Are Webhooks?

Webhooks are **server-to-server HTTP callbacks** that notify your system when specific events happen in Field Nation. Think of them as "reverse API calls" – instead of your system asking Field Nation for updates, Field Nation pushes updates to you.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant FN as Field Nation
    participant Your as Your System
    
    Note over FN: Work Order Published
    FN->>Your: POST https://your-endpoint.com/webhooks
    Note over Your: Process Event
    Your-->>FN: 200 OK
    Note over Your: Update Local Records
```

### How They Work

1. **Subscribe** - Register your HTTPS endpoint and select events to receive
2. **Event Occurs** - A work order is created, updated, or status changes
3. **Notification Sent** - Field Nation POSTs event payload to your endpoint
4. **Process & Respond** - Your system processes the event and returns 200 OK
5. **Automatic Retry** - If delivery fails, Field Nation retries with exponential backoff

## Why Use Webhooks?


  
    Receive updates within seconds of events occurring. Keep your systems in sync without polling delays.
  
  
    Eliminate constant polling. Webhooks push data only when something changes, reducing API calls by 95%+.
  
  
    Build reactive workflows that trigger automatically. Assign providers, update ERP systems, send notifications—all in real-time.
  
  
    Lower infrastructure costs. No need to run continuous polling jobs or maintain complex scheduling logic.

## Common Use Cases

### 1. **Work Order Lifecycle Automation**

Automatically respond to work order status changes:

- **Published** → Auto-assign to preferred provider
- **Assigned** → Update dispatch board, notify technician
- **Checked In** → Log start time in ERP system
- **Work Done** → Trigger approval workflow
- **Approved** → Generate invoice, update accounting system

### 2. **Real-Time Notifications**

Keep stakeholders informed instantly:

- Notify clients when work orders are completed
- Alert managers when providers decline assignments
- Send SMS/email when work is approved
- Update dashboards in real-time

### 3. **Data Synchronization**

Maintain consistent data across systems:

- Sync work order details to Salesforce, ServiceNow, or NetSuite
- Update custom dashboards and reporting tools
- Mirror Field Nation data in your database
- Replicate changes to multiple downstream systems

### 4. **Compliance & Auditing**

Track every change for regulatory requirements:

- Log all status transitions with timestamps
- Record who approved, declined, or modified work orders
- Maintain audit trails for compliance reporting
- Alert on specific event patterns

## When to Use Webhooks vs REST API

| Scenario | Use Webhooks | Use REST API |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Real-time updates** | ✅ Ideal | ❌ Requires polling |
| **Event-driven workflows** | ✅ Perfect fit | ⚠️ Complex to implement |
| **Creating work orders** | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Use POST requests |
| **Bulk data queries** | ❌ Not designed for this | ✅ Use GET endpoints |
| **On-demand data retrieval** | ❌ Event-based only | ✅ Query anytime |
| **Reducing API calls** | ✅ Push notifications | ❌ Constant polling |

> [INFO] **Best Practice**: Use webhooks for event-driven updates and REST API for on-demand queries and write operations. Most integrations use both together.
