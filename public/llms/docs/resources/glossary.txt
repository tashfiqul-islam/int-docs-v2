    - **Client ID / Client Secret** — OAuth2 credentials; keep secrets out of source control.  
    - **Company ID** — Org identifier (e.g., `/company/profile/123`).

    - **Deliverable** — Proof of completion (photos, docs, checklists).
  

  
    - **Event / Event ID** — Webhook-triggering occurrence; use IDs for idempotency.  
    - **Exponential Backoff** — Retry delays double each attempt (10s, 20s, 40s, ...).
  

  
    - **Field Mapping** — Defines how fields correspond across systems.
