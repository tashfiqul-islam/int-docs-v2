[Support resources →](/docs/resources/support)

---

### Can service companies or providers access the API?

No. Currently, Field Nation only provides API and integration access to **buyers** (companies that post work orders). Service companies and providers do not have access to API credentials or integration features.

If you're a service company interested in integration capabilities, please contact your Field Nation representative to discuss available options.





## Integration Architecture & Options

### What integration options does Field Nation offer?

Field Nation provides three primary integration approaches:

1. **Pre-built Connectors** - Out-of-the-box integrations with popular field service management platforms (Salesforce, ServiceNow, Autotask, ConnectWise, etc.). Minimal code required, configured through UI.

2. **REST API** - Direct API integration for pushing work order data to Field Nation. Use for custom integrations or when a pre-built connector isn't available.

3. **Webhooks** - Subscribe to work order events and status changes to receive real-time updates from Field Nation. Use webhooks to pull data and maintain synchronization.

Most successful integrations use a combination: REST API for pushing data and Webhooks for receiving updates.

[Choosing Your Approach →](/docs/getting-started/choosing-your-approach)

---

### What's the difference between code-based and connector integrations?

**Code-Based Integration (REST API + Webhooks):**
- Maximum flexibility and customization
- Requires coding, API knowledge, error handling logic
- Best for custom workflows, unique data transformations
- Your team maintains code, monitors APIs

**Connector Integration (Pre-built):**
- Configuration-driven, less code (or no code for out-of-the-box)
- Standardized sync with popular platforms (CRM, ERP, PSA)
- Field Nation manages connector updates, API changes, retry logic
- Best for standard workflows, quick deployment

[Platform Overview →](/docs/getting-started/platform-overview)

---

### Which platforms are supported by out-of-the-box connectors?

Field Nation provides pre-built connectors for:

- **Autotask** - Datto Autotask PSA integration
- **ConnectWise** - ConnectWise Manage integration
- **Freshdesk** - Freshdesk ticketing system
- **NetSuite** - NetSuite ERP integration
- **Quickbase** - Quickbase application integration
- **Salesforce** - Salesforce Service Cloud integration
- **ServiceNow** - ServiceNow ITSM integration
- **Smartsheet** - Smartsheet project management integration
- **Zendesk** - Zendesk Support integration

Each connector includes configuration guides, workflow documentation, and troubleshooting resources.

---

### Can I sync custom fields between systems?

Yes. Most out-of-the-box integrations support custom field synchronization. To sync custom fields:

1. **Create Corresponding Fields** - Ensure custom fields exist in both Field Nation and your external system with compatible data types
2. **Configure Field Mappings** - Map the custom fields in the Integration Broker configuration
3. **Verify Permissions** - Ensure the integration API user has access to read/write custom fields
4. **Handle Data Types** - Use appropriate data type conversions if needed

Some platforms require additional configuration. Refer to your specific connector documentation for platform-specific requirements.

---

### Should I use templates and projects in Field Nation?

Yes. Using templates and projects is strongly recommended:

**Benefits:**
- **Reduced API Payload Size** - Reference templates instead of sending all work order details
- **Consistency** - Standardized information across work orders
- **Efficiency** - Faster work order creation with pre-configured data

**What Templates Include:**
- Tasks for providers (Check In, Check Out, Photo requirements)
- Custom fields for buyers and providers
- Attachments included with work orders
- Consistent Scope of Work (SOW) formatting
- Contact information

**Best Practice**: Set up templates in Field Nation before building your integration. This minimizes the data you need to send through the API for each work order.





## REST API & Webhooks

### What data can I push and pull through the APIs?

**Push to Field Nation (REST API):**
- Create and update work orders
- Manage work order assignments
- Update work order statuses
- Submit deliverables and close-out information

**Pull from Field Nation (Webhooks):**
- Work order status changes (33 events)
- Assignment updates
- Provider responses and requests
- Task completions
- Deliverable uploads
- Payment and approval events

**Recommended Approach:**
- Use **REST API** for pushing data to Field Nation
- Use **Webhooks** for pulling data and receiving real-time updates

[Explore Webhooks →](/docs/webhooks/v3/introduction)

---

### What data do I receive in webhook payloads?

Webhook payloads include the **complete work order model**, not just snippets. When you subscribe to work order events, you receive:

- Full work order details (ID, title, description, location, schedule)
- Assignment information (provider details, status, pay rates)
- Task information (completed tasks, pending tasks)
- Custom field values
- Deliverables and attachments
- Status history and timestamps

The payload structure matches the REST API v2 work order model.

[Payload Structure →](/docs/webhooks/v3/concepts/payload-structure)

---

### How do I test webhooks during development?

To test webhooks in a local development environment:

1. **Use a Tunnel Service:**
   - [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) - Expose local servers to the internet
   - [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/) - Alternative tunnel service
   - Configure your webhook endpoint URL to point to the tunnel

2. **Set Up Your Endpoint:**
   - Ensure endpoint receives HTTP POST requests
   - Log all incoming requests for debugging
   - Return appropriate HTTP status codes (200-299 for success)

3. **Test in Sandbox:**
   - Configure webhooks in [Sandbox environment](https://ui-sandbox.fndev.net/integrations/webhooks)
   - Trigger test events in Field Nation
   - Verify payloads are received correctly

4. **Monitor Delivery Logs:**
   - Check webhook delivery logs in the Field Nation dashboard
   - Review any error responses from your endpoint
   - Verify retry behavior for failed deliveries

[Testing Guide →](/docs/webhooks/v3/guides/testing)

---

### How are timestamps handled in the API?

Timestamps are sent as **UTC with timezone offsets**. The format follows ISO 8601 standards with offset information.

**Example:**
- `2012-12-05T17:00+05:00` (UTC+5)
- `2012-12-05T18:00+06:00` (UTC+6)

Both represent the same absolute time when converted to UTC (`2012-12-06T00:00+00:00`).

**Key Points:**
- Timestamps are universal and timezone-aware
- The offset indicates the timezone of the event
- Conversion to UTC is straightforward using the offset
- The timezone may vary based on the event location and type

---

### Can I assign work orders directly from my system?

Yes, but with important considerations:

**Technical Capability:**
- The API supports direct work order assignment
- You can assign providers to work orders programmatically

**Best Practice Recommendations:**
- Field Nation's platform includes sophisticated provider vetting tools (selection rules, recommended providers, performance metrics) that aren't available via API
- Most successful integrations focus on work order creation and status synchronization rather than automated assignment
- If assigning directly, build trusted preferred provider groups based on historical performance

**Important Note**: Unless you're a W2 provider, direct assignment bypasses Field Nation's marketplace matching algorithms.





## Field Service Connectors

### What is the Integration Broker and how does it work?

The Integration Broker is Field Nation's middleware system that manages bidirectional data synchronization between Field Nation and third-party platforms. It handles:

- **Authentication** - Manages API credentials and OAuth tokens for external systems
- **Field Discovery** - Automatically reads field metadata from connected platforms
- **Data Transformation** - Translates data schemas between systems using configurable mappings
- **Message Queuing** - Ensures reliable message delivery with retry mechanisms
- **Error Handling** - Logs errors, retries failed operations, and maintains error states

The broker operates as a message-driven architecture, processing inbound (external system → Field Nation) and outbound (Field Nation → external system) data flows.

---

### How do I customize field mappings in out-of-the-box integrations?

Field mappings can be customized using several approaches:

1. **Standard Mapping Actions:**
   - **Sync** - Direct field-to-field mapping
   - **Set Static** - Assign constant values
   - **Array Map** - Transform array data
   - **Range Map** - Map value ranges
   - **Date Convert** - Transform date formats
   - **Concat** - Combine multiple fields

2. **Custom Actions with JSONNET:**
   - Write JSONNET scripts for complex transformation logic
   - Implement conditional logic (if-then-else)
   - Access utility functions for common operations
   - Handle nested data structures

3. **Conditional Logic:**
   - Use custom actions to implement business rules
   - Populate fields based on data conditions
   - Apply different mappings based on work order properties

---

### What happens if my integration encounters an error?

The Integration Broker includes comprehensive error handling:

1. **Automatic Retry** - Failed operations automatically retry with exponential backoff to handle temporary network issues or rate limits
2. **Error Logging** - Detailed error information is logged with context for troubleshooting
3. **Alerts** - Configure email notifications for integration errors
4. **Dead Letter Queue** - Operations that exceed maximum retry attempts are held for manual review

The system prevents duplicate processing while ensuring data isn't lost during temporary failures.

---

### My out-of-the-box integration stopped syncing. What should I check first?

When an integration stops syncing, check these common issues in order:

1. **Authentication** - Verify API credentials are still valid. Expired tokens, changed passwords, or revoked API keys are the most common causes.
2. **Webhooks** - Confirm webhooks are still configured correctly in the external system and haven't been disabled or modified.
3. **Permissions** - Ensure the integration user still has appropriate permissions in both systems. Role changes or permission updates can break integrations.
4. **Rate Limits** - Check if you've exceeded API rate limits in either platform.
5. **Network Connectivity** - Verify network connectivity between systems and check firewall rules.
