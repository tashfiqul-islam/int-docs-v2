## Work Orders

### Work Order
A job or task that needs to be completed at a physical location. Every integration revolves around creating, managing, or responding to work orders.

**Key Properties:**
- Unique ID for tracking
- Title and description
- Service window (schedule)
- Physical location
- Pay structure
- Status (draft, published, assigned, etc.)

### Work Order Status
Indicates the current stage of a work order in its lifecycle. Status changes trigger webhooks and determine available actions.

**Common Statuses:**
- `draft` - Not yet visible to providers
- `published` - Visible on marketplace
- `routed` - Sent to specific providers
- `assigned` - Provider committed
- `work_done` - Completed by provider
- `approved` - Accepted by buyer
- `paid` - Payment processed

### Service Window
The date and time range during which work can be performed. Service windows respect time zones and can be hours, days, or date ranges.

**Modes:**
- `hours` - Specific start and end times
- `between` - Date range flexibility
- `exact` - Precise appointment time

---

## Providers & Assignments

### Provider
An independent contractor who completes field service work. Providers have skills, certifications, ratings, and availability.

**Provider Properties:**
- User ID
- Name and contact info
- Rating (1-5 stars)
- Completed jobs count
- Skills and certifications

### Assignment
The relationship between a work order and a provider. When a provider is assigned, they're committed to completing the work.

**Assignment Process:**
1. Work order published or routed
2. Provider requests or accepts
3. Buyer confirms assignment
4. Provider completes work

### Routing
Sending a work order directly to specific providers. Routed providers receive notifications and can accept or decline.

**Routing Strategies:**
- **Manual Routing** - Select specific providers
- **Talent Pool Routing** - Route to provider groups
- **Mass Routing** - Invite multiple providers

### Talent Pool
A group of preferred providers organized by skills, geography, or performance. Simplifies routing to trusted technicians.

**Benefits:**
- Pre-vetted providers
- Faster assignment
- Consistent quality
- Tiered structures (A, B, C teams)

---

## Schedule & Time

### UTC vs Local Time
Field Nation stores all timestamps in UTC but also provides local times based on work order location.

**Best Practices:**
- Store UTC in your database
- Display local time to users
- Include timezone in API requests
- Handle daylight saving changes

### ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival)
Provider's estimated arrival time, updated in real-time as they travel to the job site.

### Check-In / Check-Out
Timestamps when providers arrive at and leave the job site. Often includes GPS coordinates for verification.

**Use Cases:**
- Time tracking
- Billing validation
- Provider accountability
- Job duration analytics

---

## Tasks & Deliverables

### Task
A specific action or requirement within a work order. Tasks form a checklist that providers must complete.

**Task Types:**
- Check-in
- Check-out
- Photos
- Signatures
- Custom requirements

**Task Status:**
- `incomplete` - Not yet done
- `complete` - Provider finished
- `not_required` - Skipped

### Deliverable
Files or data providers upload as proof of completion—photos, documents, signatures, or notes.

**Common Deliverables:**
- Before/after photos
- Network diagrams
- Signature captures
- Completion forms
- Serial number documentation

---

## Financial Concepts

### Pay Structure
How providers are compensated. Field Nation supports multiple payment models.

**Pay Types:**
- **Fixed** - Flat rate for the job
- **Hourly** - Rate per hour worked
- **Blended** - Combination of fixed and hourly
- **Device** - Per-device pricing

### Base Pay
The primary compensation amount before any additional costs, bonuses, or expenses.

### Expense
Reimbursable costs providers incur while completing work—travel, materials, parking, etc.

**Expense Categories:**
- Travel
- Mileage
- Parking
- Materials
- Other

### Bonus
Additional payment offered to incentivize work acceptance or quality performance.

**Bonus Scenarios:**
- Rush jobs
- After-hours work
- Difficult locations
- High-priority work

### Penalty
Deduction from pay due to performance issues—late arrival, incomplete work, policy violations.

---

## Integration Architecture

### REST API
Representational State Transfer API using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to manage resources.

**Characteristics:**
- Stateless requests
- JSON request/response
- OAuth 2.0 authentication
- RESTful resource URLs

### Webhook
HTTP callback that delivers real-time notifications when events occur on Field Nation.

**Webhook Flow:**
1. Event happens (e.g., work order assigned)
2. Field Nation sends POST to your endpoint
3. Your system processes the event
4. You respond with 200 OK

### Event
Something that happens on the platform—work order created, provider assigned, task completed, etc.

**Event Properties:**
- Event name (e.g., `workorder.status.assigned`)
- Timestamp
- Triggering user
- Full work order data

### OAuth 2.0
Industry-standard authentication protocol. Field Nation uses client credentials grant for machine-to-machine auth.

**Auth Flow:**
1. Exchange client ID + secret for access token
2. Include token in API request headers
3. Token expires after 1 hour
4. Refresh with new authentication request

---

## Templates & Configuration

### Template
Pre-configured work order settings that streamline creation. Templates define standard tasks, custom fields, and requirements.

**Template Benefits:**
- Consistency across work orders
- Reduced API payload size
- Faster creation
- Fewer errors

### Project
Organizational container for related work orders. Projects group similar work and apply consistent settings.

**Project Uses:**
- Multi-site rollouts
- Ongoing maintenance programs
- Customer-specific work
- Budget tracking

### Custom Field
User-defined field that extends the work order data model with organization-specific information.

**Custom Field Types:**
- Text (single line)
- Text area (multi-line)
- Number
- Date
- Dropdown (picklist)
- Checkbox

---

## Data & Transformation

### Field Mapping
Configuration that defines how data flows between your system and Field Nation. Maps your field names to Field Nation's schema.

**Mapping Actions:**
- **Sync** - Direct field-to-field copy
- **Static** - Fixed value
- **Array Map** - Lookup table (e.g., status codes)
- **Custom** - Transformation logic

### JSONNET
Data templating language used in connectors for complex field transformations.

**Use Cases:**
- Conditional logic
- Data aggregation
- Format conversion
- Calculated fields

### Broker / Middleware
Field Nation's integration layer that handles authentication, mapping, queuing, and retry logic for pre-built connectors.

**Broker Functions:**
- Manages API credentials
- Transforms data between systems
- Handles retry on failure
- Logs all operations

---

## Error Handling

### HTTP Status Codes
Standard codes indicating request success or failure:

- **200 OK** - Success
- **201 Created** - Resource created
- **400 Bad Request** - Invalid input
- **401 Unauthorized** - Auth failure
- **403 Forbidden** - Insufficient permissions
- **404 Not Found** - Resource doesn't exist
- **429 Too Many Requests** - Rate limit exceeded
- **500 Internal Server Error** - Server error

### Retry Logic
Automated attempt to resend failed requests. Uses exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming systems.

**Retry Pattern:**
- Initial delay: 10 seconds
- Double delay each attempt
- Maximum 7 attempts
- Give up after final attempt

### Dead Letter Queue
Storage for messages that failed all retry attempts. Allows manual review and recovery.

---

## Security

### Access Token
Short-lived credential (1 hour) that authorizes API requests. Obtained via OAuth 2.0.

### Client ID & Secret
Long-lived credentials that identify your application. Used to obtain access tokens.

**Security:**
- Never expose client secret in client-side code
- Store securely (environment variables, key vault)
- Rotate periodically
- Don't commit to version control

### Webhook Signature
HMAC-SHA256 hash in the `x-fn-signature` header that verifies webhook authenticity.

**Verification Process:**
1. Extract signature from header
2. Compute HMAC of request body using your secret
3. Compare signatures with timing-safe comparison
4. Reject if signatures don't match

### IP Whitelisting
Restricting webhook endpoint access to known Field Nation IP addresses.

**Field Nation IPs:**
- **Sandbox**: 44.225.211.232, 44.237.253.26
- **Production**: 3.226.5.230, 34.198.172.230

---

## Monitoring & Observability

### Delivery Log
Record of webhook delivery attempts—successes, failures, retries, and payloads.

**Log Retention:** 2 weeks

### Rate Limit
Maximum number of API requests allowed within a time window (typically 60/minute).

**Rate Limit Headers:**
- `X-Rate-Limit-Limit` - Total allowed
- `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining` - Requests left
- `X-Rate-Limit-Reset` - When limit resets

### Idempotency
Property where repeating an operation produces the same result. Important for safe retries.

**Idempotent Operations:**
- GET requests (reads)
- PUT requests (full updates)
- DELETE requests (deletions)

**Non-Idempotent:**
- POST requests (creates new resources)
